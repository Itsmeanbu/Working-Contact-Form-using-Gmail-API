## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure.
- **CSS3** for styling and layout.
- **Web3Forms** API to process form submissions.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the form in your project:

### Prerequisites

- A code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
- A Web3Forms account to obtain an `access_key` for form submissions.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/working-contact-form.git
    ```

2. **Open in Editor:**
   Navigate to the project folder and open it in your preferred editor.

3. **Set Up Web3Forms Access Key:**
   Replace the `access_key` in the form with your own Web3Forms key:
   ```html
   <input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="your-access-key-here">
   ```

### Usage

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the contact form. Fill out the form fields and submit to test the integration with Web3Forms.

## Code Overview

### HTML

The `index.html` file includes the structure for the form, connecting it to Web3Forms:

```html
<form action="https://api.web3forms.com/submit" method="POST" class="contact-left">
    <input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="your-access-key">
    <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" class="contact-inputs" required>
    <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your Email" class="contact-inputs" required>
    <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your Message" class="contact-inputs" required></textarea>
    <button type="submit">Submit <img src="arrow_icon.png" alt="Arrow Icon"></button>
</form>
```

### CSS

The `style.css` file provides the styling for a modern, clean look:

```css
body {
    font-family: 'Outfit';
    background: linear-gradient(#ffdad5, #fff7f9);
}

.contact-container {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-evenly;
    height: 100vh;
}
...
```
